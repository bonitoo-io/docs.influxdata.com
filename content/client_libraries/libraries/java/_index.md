title: The official InfluxDB Java client library.
---

There are two different approaches to access InfluxDB from Java.

* [Classic client](/client_libraries/latest/libraries/java/classic)
* [RxJava client](/client_libraries/latest/libraries/rxjava) 

The classic client follows classic Java design pattern and is something a typical Java programmer is
used to. You may want to try the reactive client if you require high performance and you are a fan of
reactive programming paradigms. See [reactivex.io](http://reactivex.io/) for more details.
